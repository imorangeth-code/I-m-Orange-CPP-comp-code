# ⚔️ Coding Grinding: The Story Behind the Code

> “Before the offer. Before the algorithms. Before the rank. There was the grind.”

## 💭 The Beginning

This repository didn’t start as a project. It started as frustration.

Tired of staring at algorithm problems that made no sense. Tired of seeing people post about offers and rankings while I felt stuck. Tired of knowing I could do more — if only I put in the reps.

So I made this.

No fancy framework. No 100-star repo. Just me, a text editor, and a daily commitment to get 1% better. This is my **coding gym**, my **dojo**, my **journal of battles won** — and lost.

If you're here, you're either curious, grinding too, or looking to level up. Welcome.

## 🧠 What This Is

This is a daily coding practice repo — but more than that, it’s a log of my process.

Every solution, every failure, every "why did I do it that way" is here. I’m not just flexing code — I’m flexing **discipline**, **problem-solving clarity**, and **consistency**.

Each day, I:

- Pick a problem (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.)
- Solve it (or struggle with it)
- Write about how I approached it
- Add reflections: what worked, what didn’t
- Test, format, and commit it with intention

No AI‑copied answers. No pastes from some solution bank. This is my brain vs. the problem — and I’m here for the fight.

## 🧱 Why Track It Publicly?

Because silent grinding is overrated.

Everyone shows off their wins. Few show the *reps*.

This repo exists to show the middle — the uncomfortable, the confusing, the “I thought this would work but it didn’t” parts. And also to show that the **grind works**.

By writing it down, explaining it, and revisiting it, I don’t just “solve” problems. I **understand** them. And over time, I build real intuition.

Also, when you make your process visible — even just to yourself — it becomes harder to skip the work.

## 💡 What I’ve Learned

- Writing out strategies makes future me smarter.
- Tests force clarity — if it fails, I can’t ignore it.
- Sometimes brute force is fine. Other times, optimization is the difference between timeout and triumph.
- Progress is exponential. The first 30 days sucked. By day 60, I could feel myself thinking faster.
- You only really "learn" an algorithm when you can write it from scratch under pressure.

## 🚀 Flex? Yeah, Kinda.

Is this repo a flex?

Maybe.

Not because I solved the hardest problems, but because I **showed up**.

This is hundreds of days of effort. Not all wins. Not all polished. But all *real*.

I didn’t just code. I reflected. I learned. I wrote it down. That’s the flex.

---

## 📈 The Results (So Far)

- Solved problems I used to avoid
- Debugged faster and with more confidence
- Learned to explain solutions clearly (great for interviews)
- Built a repo I’m proud to show

I’m not done. I never will be.

But if you’re reading this — whether to get inspired, steal the format, or just see how someone else grinds — know this:

You don’t need to be a genius. You just need to **show up** and **do the reps**.

## 🧠 Final Words

This repo is public because maybe, just maybe, someone like me — 6 months ago — finds it and realizes:

**You’re not behind. You just haven’t started grinding yet.**

Let’s work.
